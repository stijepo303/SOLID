The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is a principle of object-oriented programming
that states that objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of its subclasses without
affecting the correctness of the program.
In other words, if class B is a subclass of class A, then objects of class B should be able to be used wherever
objects of class A are expected.
